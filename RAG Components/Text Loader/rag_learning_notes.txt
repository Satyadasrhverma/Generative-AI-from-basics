RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Learning Notes

RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation.
Instead of relying only on a language model's training data, RAG retrieves relevant
documents from external knowledge sources and uses them as context to generate answers.

Key Components of RAG:
1. Data Source: PDFs, text files, databases, or web pages.
2. Text Loader: Loads raw text data from files.
3. Text Splitter: Breaks large documents into smaller chunks.
4. Embedding Model: Converts text chunks into vector representations.
5. Vector Database: Stores embeddings for fast similarity search.
6. Retriever: Finds the most relevant chunks based on a user query.
7. LLM (Generator): Generates the final answer using retrieved context.

Benefits of RAG:
- Uses up-to-date information
- Reduces hallucinations
- Supports private and large datasets
- No need to retrain the model when data changes

Example:
If a user asks, "What is RAG?"
The system retrieves relevant notes from documents and then generates
a clear, factual answer based on that information.
